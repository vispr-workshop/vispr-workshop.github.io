The great vision scientist, James J. Gibson, famously said “We see in order to move and we move in order to see.” But can we learn to see before we learn to move? And how far can we move if we first learn to see?

We are excited to have a lineup of speakers from computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. We hope that this workshop will help attract the broader CVPR community to this important and exciting topic.
